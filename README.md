# Image Processing and Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains a Python-based tool for segmenting and analyzing GeoMx DSP (Digital Spatial Profiling) data. The tool leverages various image processing techniques, machine learning, and feature extraction to achieve accurate and reliable segmentation of spatial regions of interest.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the image processing pipeline on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. You can install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your image data in the appropriate directories as described in the comments within the code.
3. Run the provided Python scripts in the following order:

   - `preprocessing.py`: Preprocesses image data and generates masks.
   - `feature_extraction.py`: Extracts features from the preprocessed images.
   - `training.py`: Trains a random forest classifier on the extracted features.
   - `testing.py`: Tests the trained classifier on new images.

4. Check the output directories for processed images and classification results.
